    question: 'How do I know if Hustle 90 is right for me?',
    answer: 'Hustle 90 is ideal for founders who have a clear vision but need technical execution help, are preparing for fundraising, or want to validate their concept quickly without hiring a full team.

    question: 'Can my team scale with Hustle 90 post-launch?',
